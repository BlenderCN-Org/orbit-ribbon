Orbit Ribbon is a game simulating a world where there is little ground and even less gravity.

The program depends upon XSDE, the excellent and quite fast XML/C++ binding. XSDE is meant to
be built custom for each app that uses it. To build xsde according to Orbit Ribbon's usage:

1. Download xsde 3.2.0.b1 for your platform, and put it in a directory here named "xsde"
2. Copy xml/xsde-3.2.0.b1-config.make over the existing xsde/config/config.make
3. Run "make" from within the xsde directory

Once you've done that, you can run scons in this directory to build Orbit Ribbon itself.

Have fun!
