Thinh's ideas:
- FOV on acceleration
- Compass
- Increase strength on strafe
- Y-axis inversion option
- More stuff in the sky for orientation
- Reduced rotation speed, cap

- Consider having an optimized-output build mode that does some of the following:
	- Enables optimization flags (compare -O2 with -O3 to see if latter helps...)
	- Builds the entire project at once to see if g++'s unit-at-a-time thing helps
	- Uses g++'s profiling mechanism with some kind of demo

- Come up with a simple way to do documentation; doxygen's usual format is a pain in the ass
- Pass boost::shared_ptr by const reference wherever possible
- Make the naming of variables consistent (in particular, use underscore prefix for members)
- Make sure mipmapping and texture compression are both actually working
- Figure out how to turn off warnings on arguments I want to ignore (i.e. some of the sdl_rwops stuff in resman.cpp)
