== ROADMAP ==
* Fix bugs:
  * Weird lighting difference between menu-load and cli-load
  * Segfault on cli-load win state
* Add background stuff
* Get it to build on Windows
* Seperate out the ORE file into its own package
* Include build date & top commit id in version (seperate into its own tiny TU so that compilation time isn't affected)
  * Rebuild this TU in SConstruct when either commit id or date changes from prior value
* Skeletal animation (implement only running and fly-to-run transition at first)
---> Release as alpha1. Dan can try it out at this stage.
* Music & sound effects
* Implement more animations
* Make the HUD better
* Shadows
* Particles
* Implement simple versions of some of the story missions
* Do a Shadow-of-the-Colossus type of effect on jungle-leaf textures
* Inside/outside effect (HDR?), with light shining through leaves nicely if possible
---> Release as alpha2. Try to reach this point by end of service.

== OTHER STUFF TO DO ==
Thinh's ideas:
- FOV on acceleration
- More stuff in the sky for orientation
- Reduced rotation speed, cap

- Consider having an optimized-output build mode that does some of the following:
	- Enables optimization flags (compare -O2 with -O3 to see if latter helps...)
	- Builds the entire project at once to see if g++'s unit-at-a-time thing helps
	- Uses g++'s profiling mechanism with some kind of demo

- Speed cap enforced with non-linear drag
- After generating packed textures, VBOs, etc, save to local system and restore for quick loading
  - Need to make sure to discard cache if video card/driver changes, or if source data is updated
- Generate a log file with all debug messages
- For the sake of UI juiciness and following the theme, give the mouse cursor a little bit of momentum ala Per.Oxyd
- FTGL sucks, implement a simple texture-submap-based font system to use instead, bundle fonts into executable
- Come up with a simple way to do documentation; doxygen's usual format is a pain in the ass
- Pass boost::shared_ptr by const reference wherever possible
- Make the naming of variables consistent (in particular, use underscore prefix for members)
- Make sure mipmapping and texture compression are both actually working
- Use a test texture instead of a test color for untextured faces
- Consider using texture packing
- Have the ORE file include pre-calculated information about how much memory must be allocated for the VBOs
- Show the loading animation while loading
- Include all resources in the ORE file (including loading anim, title screen image, sounds, etc)
- Separate out the ORE file into its own repository
- Allow video mode to be changed without having to reinit the entire display module
- Maybe when it is necessary to tilt about z axis while running, I should add some x linear force to simulate banking. Banking would actually occur, since one foot would be pushing sideways to adjust orientation, right?
