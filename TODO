Thinh's ideas:
- FOV on acceleration
- Compass
- Increase strength on strafe
- Y-axis inversion option
- More stuff in the sky for orientation
- Reduced rotation speed, cap

- Consider having an optimized-output build mode that does some of the following:
	- Enables optimization flags (compare -O2 with -O3 to see if latter helps...)
	- Builds the entire project at once to see if g++'s unit-at-a-time thing helps
	- Uses g++'s profiling mechanism with some kind of demo
